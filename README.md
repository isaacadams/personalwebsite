## Ideas

commit activity log
- pull public commits from github
- display them in a list on subpage
- add filter

.failure log
- had this interesting today of a "failure log"
- goes along with the concept that failure is the precursor to success
- text entries of daily struggles / failures
- feed format w/ date
